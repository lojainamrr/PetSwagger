## ✅ Project Workflow

### 1. Test Planning & Design  
- Reviewed all endpoints provided by the Petstore API  
- Designed detailed test cases for CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE)  
- Included edge cases, boundary values, and negative scenarios

### 2. Postman Collection Setup  
- Created modular, folder-based collections  
- Utilized environments and variables for flexibility  
- Added *test scripts* to validate:
  - Status codes  
  - Response body and structure  
  - Headers and response time

### 3. Test Execution  
- Ran tests manually and using Postman's *Collection Runner*  
- Captured evidence (screenshots) for failed test cases  
- Tracked results with clear pass/fail indicators

### 4. Bug Reporting  
- Identified and logged API issues  
- Documented bugs with:
  - Clear summary  
  - Steps to reproduce  
  - Expected vs actual behavior  
  - Severity and priority labels
